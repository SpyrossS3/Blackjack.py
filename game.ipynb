    "- Dealing the Cards\n",
    "  - There are 52 cards in a single deck.\n",
    "  - Most commonly, 6 decks, 312 cards, are used for the deal\n",
    "    - A range of 60-75 cards are cut out of the total 312 at the bottom of the pack after shuffling\n",
    "- The Start of the Game\n",
    "  - The player is dealt two cards face up, the computer has one card face up\n",
    "  - During this time, Insurance or Surrender can be performed\n",
    "- Game Play\n",
    "  - If the computer's face-up card is a 10-card (A 10 or picture card), then they will look at their face-down and see if it is a Blackjack, if it is not a Blackjack, the card is not revealed until the player has completed their play\n",
    "  - The player continues to play until they bust or stand\n",
    "  - Once the player has busted, the game ends and they immediately lose, and the computer's cards are revealed\n",
    "  - If the player stands, then the computer plays until they either bust, stand, or hit Blackjack\n",
    "    - If the computer busts, the player immediately wins\n",
    "    - If the computer stands, the two are compared to see which is closer to 21\n",
    "    - If the computer continues to hit, they may hit Blackjack, and if so, either draws or wins immediately\n",
    "      - They only draw with the player if the player also got Blackjack"
